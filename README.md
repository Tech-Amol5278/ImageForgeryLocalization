# ImageForgeryLocalization
This project focuses on detecting and localizing image forgeries using a deep learning approach. It leverages a CNN-based U-Net architecture to generate heatmaps that highlight manipulated regions in an image. The repository includes the full training workflow and a prototype for real-time inference.
